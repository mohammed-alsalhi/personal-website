          <p>
              I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, but honestly, most of my energy goes into whatever I'm tinkering with on the side.

              I'm also kind of obsessed with history and politics — specifically, the messy, human side of how power actually works. 
              How do institutions evolve? Why do some decisions from decades ago still haunt us? What's happening in the backrooms while everyone's watching the stage?
          </p>
          <p>
              I read constantly, gravitating toward anything that challenges how I see society, identity, or strategy.
              Right now I'm working through Notes from Underground.
              When I travel, I skip the tourist spots and just walk. I watch how people navigate a city, where the design works and where it breaks down, all those tiny details that reveal what a place is actually like.
          </p>
          <p>
              I'm a huge fan of strategy games, the kind where every choice cascades into something bigger.
              Right now I'm deep into Worldwide Rush, Subway Builder, and Hearts of Iron IV.
